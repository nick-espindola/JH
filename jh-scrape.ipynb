       "20  I was recently talking to my best friend about this song and he brought up something that I never really thought about. This bar seems to be a place that people who could have gone a different path in life end up. At the end of the song there's the line \"man what are you doing here?\". Is the narrator also one of these people that could have been something greater due to his skill but never ended up going down that path? I thought it was interesting to think about what his story is. My wife suggested something a little more hopeful in that the narrator is just at the start of his career which is why he is so skilled but is at this bar. Curious what everyone else thinks.  \\n- Nate!   \n",

       "20  I was recently talking to my best friend about this song and he brought up something that I never really thought about. This bar seems to be a place that people who could have gone a different path in life end up. At the end of the song there's the line \"man what are you doing here?\". Is the narrator also one of these people that could have been something greater due to his skill but never ended up going down that path? I thought it was interesting to think about what his story is. My wife suggested something a little more hopeful in that the narrator is just at the start of his career which is why he is so skilled but is at this bar. Curious what everyone else thinks.  \\n- Nate!   \n",
